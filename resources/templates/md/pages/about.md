## Carreer
I've worked professionally as a programmer since 2001. The goals has always been to stay a coder and not go down the management path. Coding is simply too much fun.

My first job lasted 10 years, at a Norwegian HR-software startup. I eventually became the lead maintainer of the web application,
coding in Java and Javascript. Frameworks used were Apache Struts, Apache Tapestry and Spring.

Since 2011 I've been working with simulation software for the Norwegian offshore industry. The main application was built on the
Netbeans platform in Java. After a couple years the company started moving more and more functionality to the web, giving me a chance to experiment
with Clojure. Since then I've mostly worked with Clojure web servers and Single Page Applications written in Clojurescript.

## Clojure
I've been in love with many different technologies during my carreer. Struts, Tapestry, Groovy, Coffeescript, AngularJS.
They were all great for a year or two, and then I got bored. I was expecting the same to happen with Clojure, 
but it's been quite a few years now and the love is still strong.

Reagent was an obvious choice for me when I started learning about Clojurescript. I stayed with it, and eventually re-frame came
along. I've been making re-frame apps full time for 2-3 years now, and it's still very productive and great fun.

This year I collected my accumulated best practices and put them into a library, [kee-frame](https://github.com/ingesolvoll/kee-frame).

## Talks
When I manage to gather enough courage, I like to tell other people about my experiences. Not many were caught on video, but
[this Norwegian one from Trondheim developer conference was](https://vimeo.com/146478440).
