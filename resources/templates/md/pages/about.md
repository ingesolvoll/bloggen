## Carreer
I've worked professionally as a programmer since 2001. The goals has always been to stay a coder and not go down the management path. Coding is simply too much fun.

My first job lasted 10 years, at a Norwegian HR-software startup. I eventually became the lead maintainer of the web application,
coding in Java and Javascript. Frameworks used were Apache Struts, Apache Tapestry and Spring.

Since 2011 I've been working with simulation software in the Norwegian offshore industry. The main application is built on the
Netbeans platform in Java. After a couple years the company started moving more and more functionality to the web, giving me a chance to experiment
with Clojure. Since then I've mostly worked with Clojure web servers and Single Page Applications written in Clojurescript.
